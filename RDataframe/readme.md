  
##Code for Project
  
see the [class diagram](./Dataframe_Class.svg). 
  
The dataframe library consists of:
  - a node class, which is the code to create the node which houses a column or variable information for the dataframe.
  - the dataframe class proper, which contains references to all information contained in the dataframe structure
  - a Unit Test module which is the non-member main() function.

See the doxygen documentation for this project.

###Design Notes:
  
The Design decisions implemented in the code relate as well to classes elsewhere, particularly the CSVUtils which is called here in the Dataframe class in order to import datasets from disk
